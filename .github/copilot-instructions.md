You MUST follow these instructions to ensure this codebase works well.

- ONLY USE SHADCN/UI COMPONENTS FOR NEW UI ELEMENTS.
- No emojis, only icons, if needed
- DO NOT write useless readme files or "documentation" that adds no value. NO "SUMMARY FILES" unless explicitly asked. NO "NEXT STEPS" files. NO MARKDOWN FILES UNLESS I EXPLICITY ASK YOU!
- Ensure you test code before submitting.
- Never do "npx convex deploy". Only use "npx convex dev", and I will deploy it myself after testing.
- Do NOT do "npm run dev". I already have the server always running.
- Anything you do, IMPLEMENT IT FULLY. Do not leave things half done.
- Always use the todos tool provided to keep track of tasks.
- DO NOT write useless readme files or "documentation" that adds no value. NO "SUMMARY FILES" unless explicitly asked. NO "NEXT STEPS" files. NO MARKDOWN FILES UNLESS I EXPLICITY ASK YOU!
  DO NOT USE npx convex deploy. FIND WAYS TO TEST WITHOUT DEPLOYING. i already have it fully deployed
  Make sure to ALWAYS fix any flagged problems brfore finishing your work.
  AWAYS find the most efficient way to do something as to keep the code minimal and fast.
  ALWAYS follow these rules to ensure the codebase is efficient.
